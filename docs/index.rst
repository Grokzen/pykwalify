Installation
------------

Latest stable release from pypi

    $ pip install pykwalify

or from source

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py install



PyYaml and ruamel.yaml
----------------------

In release ``1.6.0`` ``PyYaml`` will be deprecated in favor of ``ruamel.yaml``.

``PyYaml`` is still the default installed one but it will removed in release 1.7.0 and ``ruamel.yaml`` will be the new default yaml parser lib from that release and forward.

This decision was based on the following thread in the `PyYaml` repo https://bitbucket.org/xi/pyyaml/issues/59/has-this-project-been-abandoned
